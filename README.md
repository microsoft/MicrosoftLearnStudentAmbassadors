## ðŸ’¡ Tips to deliver a presentation 
A Lunch and Learn style or an After Hours session works well with students. The content can combine a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador program information session with a technical talk to showcase the learning possibilities and students can unlock their potential with the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador program.   

If you do not want to host your own event, you may want to leverage an existing community event or lecture to provide a quick overview on the program for attendees and follow up with a call to action.  

**1. Host a talk**

Every student community will be different in how they engage with you. The first step is to think about where you want to host your presentation? For example: 

- In person at a university or tertiary institution campus  
- Teams meeting 
- LinkedIn live 

**2. Decide your presentation content**
 
- Check out [Find a Student Ambassador](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/search?target=profile&program=MLSA) to see if a student in your local area can co-host or speak with you. You can ask them about their experiences being part of the community and how the program has helped unlock their potential and open opportunities to grow their career.
- Consider combining a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador information session with a technical talk to provide added value for students and inspire them for what they can continue to learn about. If you need a technical speaker, go to [Find an MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/search?target=Profile&program=MVP) and reach out using their social media profiles, or contact your local Microsoft Community Manager.  
 
**3. Use supporting materials**
 
- Use the walking deck to empower students to unlock their potential by joining the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador program.
- Why not include a technical talk in your presentation? Check out the [technical lessons at here](https://github.com/microsoft/cloud-advocate-workshops) or [Generative AI for Beginners](https://microsoft.github.io/generative-ai-for-beginners/#/).
 

**4. Follow up post-talk**
 

- Share the [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/studentambassadors) website with participants post-talk to remind them on how to join the community by clicking "Get Started".  

- Create a social media post with a call to action to inspire students to unlock their potential and join the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador community at https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/studentambassadors and tag #MSFTStudentAmbassadors. Copy the suggested text from the Social Media Assets section above.
